I made this as a part of an AI Programming class. 
This algorithm was framed as a game where a certain agent (called a 'cat') tries to find its
way out of a grid by moving itself towards the outside border. At the start there are
a few randomly generated blockers that take up a grid space, and more blockers are
spawned at the point the cat is trying to get to in an attempt to fully wall it in.
Because of this, some variables and classes are reliant or inherited from the given
cMake framework code. I left the framework out because I'm just trying to display the specific algorithm.

To see this in operation, see https://github.com/alex-lanthier/AI_Lab_02 and select the catchthecat startup item.
When the win or loss condition is met, the program aborts. This sample is cleaned up from the original version,
but the functionality is the same
